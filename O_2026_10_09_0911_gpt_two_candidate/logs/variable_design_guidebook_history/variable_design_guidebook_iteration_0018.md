# runtime variable design guidebook

this file is the direct, code-validated rule snapshot returned by the experience llm. confidence is the experience llm's evidence assessment, not a probability calculated or upgraded by code. every rule is a trend, not a universal physical law.

## active rules



rule=r-0018-01
domain={a:[115.00,115.00],b:[50.00,50.00],l1:[22.50,22.50],l2:[15.00,15.00],l3:[35.00,35.00],s1:[0.80,0.80],s2:[4.00,4.35],s3:[0.50,0.50],f_l:[11.00,11.00]}
var_change={s2:u}
effect={low_resonance_point:k,s11_at_2_45:d,high_resonance_point:k,s11_at_4_50:d}
confidence=0.87
note=In this tightly matched baseline, increasing s2 from 4.00 toward 4.35 generally deepens S11 at both fixed targets while resonances remain near 2.45-2.46 and 4.52-4.53 GHz; the trend is local and response is not fully monotonic.



rule=r-0018-02
domain={a:[115.00,115.00],b:[50.00,50.00],l1:[22.50,22.50],l2:[15.00,15.00],l3:[35.00,35.00],s1:[0.80,0.80],s2:[4.00,4.00],s3:[0.50,0.50],f_l:[11.00,11.00]}
var_change={l3:u}
effect={low_resonance_point:l,s11_at_2_45:s,high_resonance_point:k,s11_at_4_50:s}
confidence=0.68
note=With other variables matched, increasing l3 from 35 toward 37.5-40 mm moves the low resonance lower and generally makes both target S11 values shallower; the high resonance stays near 4.5 GHz, and the high-target depth change is modest.
